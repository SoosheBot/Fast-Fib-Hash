## Is there a difference between rendering a Fibonacci sequence recursively vs with a hash in Python? Go see for yourself.

### Along with being a fun little way to show the difference between recursing vs hashing through a Fibonacci sequence, this page is also my first attempt at posting Python code online. Thanks to [Bhavini Ravi's incredibly helpful Medium article](https://medium.com/bhavaniravi/build-your-1st-python-web-app-with-flask-b039d11f101c), I'm using Flask to make it happen.

## Quick Installation Fieldnotes for Flask (MacOS)
```
(In the terminal. Assuming you have Python 3.)
$ mkdir yourproject
$ cd yourproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install Flask

*For info on how to do this for Python 2, visit the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#install-create-env) website*
